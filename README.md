# Eat The Burgers
### Summary:
This app lets users input names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the screen and will stay there untill it is "eaten" by clicking a button, which will move the burger to the other side of the page. This app stores all data inside a MYSQL database, and follows the CRUD format.
